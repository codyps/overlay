* Adding with layman:

  layman -a jmesmon

  layman -f -a toolchain-for-funtoo -o http://raw.github.com/jmesmon/overlay/master/overlays.xml

* For the 'toolchain-for-funtoo' repository, you'll need my patches to layman to enable the fetching of branches.

  cd /etc/portage
  git clone https://github.com/jmesmon/overlay -b patches patches

  # use foobashrc (more reliable)
  # Or edit /etc/portage/bashrc to call 'epatch_user' at an appropriate time.
  # for example:

	post_source_prepare () {
		epatch_user
	}

* TODO

 * brscan2 from source
